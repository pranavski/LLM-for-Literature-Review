## Description

This file documents my findings from using an LLM to answer questions from the past few weeks.

## Question

I don't understand what Lean is, and want to figure out its uses, reasons, and purpose, and how it plays into the Natural Number Game.

## What is Lean?

- Lean is a powerful, open-source theorem prover and programming language developed by Microsoft Research.
- It's designed to bridge the gap between computational proof and human-readable mathematics.

Key points about Lean:

1. **Purpose:** 
   - Used for formalizing mathematics and writing machine-checkable proofs
   - Allows expression of complex mathematical concepts and verification of their correctness

2. **Features:**
   - Dependent type theory: Rich type system allowing types to depend on values
   - Tactics: Language for writing proofs in a natural, step-by-step manner
   - Metaprogramming: Users can extend Lean's capabilities with custom tactics and automation

3. **Uses:**
   - Formal verification of mathematical proofs
   - Teaching mathematical reasoning and proof techniques
   - Developing verified software
   - Exploring foundations of mathematics

4. **Relation to the Natural Number Game:**
   - Interactive tutorial built using Lean
   - Teaches basics of theorem proving and formal mathematics using natural numbers
   - Players learn Lean's syntax and tactics while exploring properties of natural numbers

5. **Advantages:**
   - Rigorous verification: Computer-checked proofs reduce risk of human error
   - Collaborative mathematics: Easier sharing and building upon others' work
   - Bridging formal and informal mathematics: Makes formal proofs more accessible

6. **Challenges:**
   - Learning curve: Requires familiarity with formal logic and proof theory
   - Formalization effort: Translating informal proofs into Lean can be time-consuming

## What Role does Lean have in establishing proofs in the Natural Numbers Game?

-- Introduce the hypothesis into the context
intro h,
-- Rewrite the goal using known equalities for `add_succ` and `add_zero`
rw [add_succ, add_succ, add_zero] at h,
-- Apply the `succ_inj` (successor injection) lemma repeatedly to simplify
repeat { apply succ_inj } at h,
-- Apply `zero_ne_succ` to establish that zero cannot be the successor of any number
apply zero_ne_succ h
